Break down algorithm into the seperate stages and time them:
Preamble
Transform
DCT
iDCT
Rebounds
then back to transform
(essentially the entire make_cart method)

Test it against these type of data:
Homogenous data
Random
Real World

Always change values as a function of grid size

Time each component and look at the amount of data as this gives the no of iterations

try fft libraries and extract the real part as this is the same as the DCT.
